# lets-rebase
Just a simple repo demonstrating why one should consider rebasing over merging.

In this repo, we use a simple example of a collaborative shopping list to demonstate the following:

- Git History:
    - Trunk Based Development (TBD)
    - Branching and Merging
    - Branching with Rebase
- Use rebase over merge (when TBD)
- How to Rebase (on Branch)
    - Note: It replays commit by commit
    - Note: Always check `git status` when rebase
    - Note: Rewrite history
- Squashing commits with Git (Grouping logical commits together)
- \[BONUS\] I messed up... What can I do?
